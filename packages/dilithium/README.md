### dilithium

Originally based on [mesur-io/dilithium](https://github.com/mesur-io/dilithium).

The purpose of this module is to maintain an independent tool chain for dilithium in js based on the original submission to NIST.

This module should be considered highly unstable until dilithium alg and kty are registered with IANA.
